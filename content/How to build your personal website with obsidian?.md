## Why anyone would want to have a personal site?

No matter who you are, what you do, and how old you are, it's almost always a good idea to claim your own turf on the internet, and show the world your work. I learned this belief
from the book *Show your work* from Austin Kleon. By the way, this is the NO.1 takeaway Austin wanted any reader to grasp from this book. 

So I claimed mine, and this is it, this very site your are visiting now. I'm glad to have it. 

I want to And I'll write down the process of how I did that, in case someone else would make use of it.

**Title: How to build your personal website with obsidian?**
from the book *Show your work* from Austin Kleon. By the way, this is the NO.1 takeaway Austin wanted any reader to grasp: **You don't have to be a genius. You just have to be a good documentarian of your own process.**

Think about it. The biggest hurdle for most people isn't a lack of skill; it's the pressure to present a finished, perfect masterpiece. Kleon flips that script entirely. He argues that the real value—for you and your audience—lies in sharing the journey: the messy drafts, the half-baked ideas, the things you're learning right now.

And this is where Obsidian becomes such a powerful tool. It’s not just a note-taking app; it's a digital workshop for your brain. So, how do you turn that workshop into a public-facing website? You start by embracing Kleon's core principle: **"Share something small every day."**

Your Obsidian vault is already filling up with these "small somethings"—your daily notes, meeting summaries, quotes from books you're reading, or nascent project ideas. The magic happens when you begin to connect these dots using Obsidian’s linking and backlinking features. A note about a marketing strategy can link to a note about consumer psychology you wrote last month. Without even trying, you're creating a web of interconnected knowledge.

Building your website then becomes less about *creating* new content from scratch and more about *curating* what you’re already learning and thinking about. You can use plugins like "Digital Garden" or "Publish" to seamlessly publish select notes from your vault to the web. Your personal site becomes a living document, an open notebook that showcases your thinking in progress.

This approach perfectly aligns with Kleon’s advice: you're not mounting a grand exhibition once a year; you're leaving the door to your studio open every single day. You build an audience by being consistently present, sharing your curiosities and processes authentically. In doing so, you attract people who are interested in your field not because you have all the answers, but because they want to follow how you're asking the questions.

Ultimately, building a website with Obsidian is the technical implementation of a profoundly simple idea: stop hiding your work. Start
